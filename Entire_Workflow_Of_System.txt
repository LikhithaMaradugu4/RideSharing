COMPLETE SYSTEM WORKFLOW (LOCKED)

This is the final mental model of your platform.

1️⃣ ACTORS IN THE SYSTEM
👤 Users (OTP-based)

Rider

Driver

Fleet Owner (Business)

🧑‍💼 Admins (Email + Password)

Platform Admin

Tenant Admin

Admins and Users are completely separate flows.

2️⃣ AUTHENTICATION & IDENTITY
Users

Login via Phone + OTP

On first OTP verification:

app_user row is created (minimal data)

JWT is issued

User is always a Rider by default

Admins

Login via email/password

Session-based auth

No OTP, no JWT, no onboarding

3️⃣ CORE DATA PRINCIPLES (VERY IMPORTANT)

app_user = identity

Roles like Driver / Fleet Owner are capabilities, not flags

Capabilities are inferred by existence of related records

No user_roles table

4️⃣ DRIVER WORKFLOW
Step 1: Driver Apply

Any logged-in user can apply as driver

driver_profile is created with:

approval_status = PENDING

Driver uploads documents:

Driving License

Aadhaar

Photo

Documents stored in user_kyc

No vehicle categories set yet

Step 2: Tenant Admin Reviews Driver

Tenant admin views:

Driver profile

Uploaded documents

Admin decides:

Approve or Reject driver

On approval:

driver_profile.approval_status = APPROVED

Admin sets allowed_vehicle_categories

e.g. ['BIKE', 'AUTO']

👉 Driver cannot self-declare allowed vehicles

5️⃣ FLEET CONCEPT (CRITICAL DECISION)
Fleet = Vehicle Ownership Unit

Not necessarily a company.

There are two fleet types:

🚗 INDIVIDUAL Fleet

Represents a single driver’s ownership

Auto-created when driver is approved

fleet_type = INDIVIDUAL

approval_status = APPROVED

No company documents

Used only for that driver’s vehicles

Driver never manually applies for this fleet.

🏢 BUSINESS Fleet

Explicitly created by fleet owners

fleet_type = BUSINESS

Requires company documents (fleet_document)

Approved by tenant admin

Can manage multiple vehicles and drivers

6️⃣ VEHICLE OWNERSHIP (VERY IMPORTANT)

Every vehicle belongs to a fleet

Vehicles NEVER belong directly to drivers

Driver adds vehicles under their INDIVIDUAL fleet

Fleet owners add vehicles under their BUSINESS fleet

This keeps schema clean and scalable.

7️⃣ VEHICLE ADDING RULES
Common rules

Fleet must exist

Fleet must be APPROVED

Backend resolves fleet automatically (frontend does not pass fleet_id)

🚗 Individual Fleet (Driver)

Driver must be APPROVED

allowed_vehicle_categories must be set

Vehicle category must be allowed by license

❌ Bike license → cannot add Car
✅ Auto license → can add Auto only

🏢 Business Fleet

No license-category restriction

Vehicle assignment handled later

8️⃣ VEHICLE ONBOARDING FLOW

Vehicle onboarding happens in steps:

Create Vehicle (basic record)

Add Vehicle Specs

Upload Vehicle Documents (RC, Insurance)

Upload Vehicle Photos

All files:

Uploaded by frontend

Backend stores URLs only

9️⃣ DASHBOARD & ACCESS BEHAVIOR

Dashboards are always visible

Actions are gated at API level

Driver Dashboard

Not applied → show “Apply”

Pending → show “Under Review”

Approved → full access

Same pattern for fleet owners.

10️⃣ PROFILE MANAGEMENT

app_user is created at OTP time with minimal data

User completes profile later:

Name

Gender

City

Profile can be updated

Profile cannot be deleted

11️⃣ WHAT ADMINS DO
Platform Admin

Create tenants

Create tenant admins

View everything

Tenant Admin

Approve drivers

Set allowed vehicle categories

Approve fleets (business)

Review vehicle documents

Admins do not go through user onboarding.

12️⃣ KEY LOCKED DESIGN DECISIONS (READ THIS)

Fleet is an ownership unit, not always a company

Individual drivers get auto-created fleets

Vehicle ownership is always via fleet

Allowed vehicle categories are set by admin, not driver

No role flags for driver/fleet owner in app_user

No user_roles table

Backend never handles file uploads

🧠 ONE-LINE SYSTEM SUMMARY (VERY USEFUL)

Users authenticate via OTP, apply for capabilities, admins approve them, fleetsfleets

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION – ENTITY CREATION RULES

1. Driver Apply Flow
- When a user applies as a driver:
  - ONLY a row is created in `driver_profile`
  - approval_status = PENDING
  - NO fleet is created at this stage
  - allowed_vehicle_categories MUST be NULL

- Driver apply is ONLY an application, not approval.

- Fleet for driver MUST NOT be created during driver apply.

- Fleet creation for driver happens ONLY AFTER tenant admin approval.



2. Fleet Owner Apply Flow (BUSINESS)

- When a user applies as a fleet owner (business):
  - ONLY a row is created in the fleet application context
    (i.e., an unapproved fleet record with approval_status = PENDING)
  - This represents a fleet owner application, NOT an approved fleet.

- Vehicles MUST NOT be allowed at this stage.

- This row is considered "pending fleet application".



3. Tenant Admin Approval (VERY IMPORTANT)

- ONLY TENANT ADMIN can approve applications
- Platform admin MUST NOT approve drivers or fleets

Approval behavior:

A) Driver Approval:
- Tenant admin approves driver_profile
- Tenant admin sets allowed_vehicle_categories
- AFTER approval:
    → Create a row in `fleet` with:
       - owner_user_id = driver_id
       - fleet_type = INDIVIDUAL
       - approval_status = APPROVED
- This fleet represents the driver's individual fleet

B) Fleet Owner (Business) Approval:
- Tenant admin approves the pending fleet
- Update approval_status = APPROVED
- fleet_type = BUSINESS



4. HARD RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)

- Fleet rows MUST NOT be created at apply time for drivers
- Fleet rows MUST NOT be auto-created by users
- Fleet rows MUST be created/approved ONLY by tenant admin action
- Vehicles can be added ONLY AFTER:
    - Fleet exists
    - Fleet.approval_status = APPROVED

Tenant lifecycle is managed OFFLINE and created ONLY by Platform Admin
